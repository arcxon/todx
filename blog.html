                It officially becomes a stable app. It has been a wonderful journey with the app. Some new functionality is the better handling of tagless Lists. And a change in the status command to stats as in statistics. This change was introduced to remove ambiguity. We are constantly innovating and pushing forward to a brighter future. We hope that our app can help you make your life easier.
