Installation
============


Currently Source code is available on github and can be compiled with any modern c++ compiler. although only g++ is tested and recommended.

..  Note::  The users of TC++ should know that thier compiler is older than me, and is supported neither by Borland nor by me. Please switch to g++.

Linux
******

1. Clone the repo using ``git clone https://github.com/arcxon/todx.git`` or Download the Source zip.

2. Use the command ``g++ -o main.cpp todx.out`` to compile the executable.

3. Now the ``todx.out`` file can be used anywhere. Just place it in your desired folder and execute in the command-line : ``./todx.out`` to enjoy the app.

..  Note:: You should also copy ``help.txt`` so that :ref:`help` command works.

Binary Executables
******************

There is a plan to offer stable binary builds for both Linux and Windows. Please Remain Calm and use compilation till then.
