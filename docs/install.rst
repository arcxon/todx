============

Currently Source code is available on github and can be compiled with any c++ compiler. although only g++ is tested and recommended.

..  Note::  The users of TC++ should know that thier compiler is older than me, and is supported neither by Borland nor by me. Please switch to g++.

Linux
-----

1) Clone the repo using
``git clone https://github.com/arcxon/todx.git``
or Download the Source zip.

2) Use the command
``g++ -o main.cpp todx.out``
to compile the executable.

3) Now the ``todx.out`` file can be used anywhere. Just place it in your desired folder and execute in the command-line : ``./todx.out`` to enjoy the app.
